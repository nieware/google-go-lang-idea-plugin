# Google Go language plugin for IntelliJ Idea

Google go language plugin is an attempt to build an outstanding IDE for
[Google Go language](http://golang.org) using Intellij IDEA.

## What it does

* Basic language parsing and highlighting
* Code folding
* Brace matching
* Comment/Uncomment (Single/Multiple line) support
* Go SDK (work with the latest release and on windows)
* File type icon
* Go application file and library generation.
* Auto completion of sdk package names and/or local application packages.
* Compilation of the go applications (supported semantics are similar to those of gobuild)
* Go To definition (for types) works across files and Go SDK
* Code formatting - experimental (disabled)
* Type name completion
* ColorsAndSettings page with a new color scheme
* Automatically add new line at end of file
* Force UTF-8 encoding for go files
* Go module type
* Go SDK indexing mode

## How to use it

* Download and install Intellij IDEA (Ultimate or Community edition) or any other IntelliJ IDE
that is build on the IDEA 133.326+ platform
* Open the Plugins installation page: File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Available Plugins
* Search for google go
* Right click on the proper plugin and install
* Download [latest release of the Google Go language](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).
* Build and install it.
* Open IDEA and create an empty Go project.
* Go to File -> Project Structure and select SDKs entry in the left column of the new window
* Add a new Google Go SDK by clicking the plus sign an choosing the appropriate SDK type. (See MacOS note below)
* After the SDK is defined go to the Modules entry and add a new google facet to your default module.
Select the proper sdk for the module.
* If you have only one directory in the ``` GOPATH ``` and you are creating a project inside that path
when you are working with packages that are part of the project you must still specify the whole import
path for them, not the relative one. Example:
    - ``` GOPATH ``` is: ``` /home/florin/go ```
    - the correct way to setup a project called ``` demogo ``` is: ``` /home/florin/go/src/github.com/dlsniper/demogo/ ```
    - new package is: ``` /home/florin/go/src/github.com/dlsniper/demogo/newpack ```
    - the correct import statement is: ``` github.com/dlsniper/demogo/newpack ``` not ``` newpack ```


Now you are ready to play with golang.

_NOTE:_ In MacOS you may need to press <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>&#8679;</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> in Finder dialog and enter `/usr/local/go` if Go in installed 
using package installer)
